Welcome to QuantumSync, where your data storage takes a _quantum leap forward!_ <br />
* This repo implements a peer-to-peer communication system over a TCP network, offering a robust and decentralized solution for file storage that’s sure to entangle your interest. 
* QuantumSync allows you to upload files to the network effortlessly, fetch files from your local disk, and if they aren't available locally, the system will retrieve them from other peers faster than you can say _beam me up_. 
* You can also delete files across the network with the ease of flipping a _quantum switch_. For enhanced data protection and privacy, all data is stored in encrypted form across the peers, effectively making it your very own _data cloaking device_. 
* The folder system is managed by a Content Addressable System (CAS), where keys are also encrypted, _adding layers of shields for data protection_. QuantumSync ensures your data isn't just secure—it's _quantum secure_, providing you with a storage solution that operates with the _speed of light_ and the security of a fortified vault.<br> 
#### Get ready to store your data with QuantumSync and experience a storage solution that's out of this world!
